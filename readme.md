# Analogous Fingerprints (Research)

This is a research project to investigate and determine if a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be used to associate never before seen fingerprints with known individuals that have only had a single fingerprint scanned before.

## Dataset
This project plans to use the [Sokoto Conventry Fingerprint Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10609) to train the model.
